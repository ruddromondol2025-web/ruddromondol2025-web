Hi, I’m Ruddro Mondol. I am a learner and an emerging researcher in physics, working mainly in the field of astronomy. I am deeply interested in understanding and explaining different astronomical events and theories, and I am continuously trying to solve the questions that inspire me.
As a Physics graduate, I am committed to improving myself every day so I can grow into the best version of who I want to be in astrophysics. I work hard, stay focused, and remain confident in my abilities. This confidence and dedication help me take on challenging problems and push myself to learn more.
I believe these qualities will continue to support me as I move forward in my journey in physics and research.

Skills: WORD / ZOTERO/ PYTHON /EXCEL
